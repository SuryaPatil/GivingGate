# GivingGate
A decentralized charity fund powered by blockchain where corporations can donate to, and where recent ex-felons can withdraw money from. This solves two important issues: 1) Many ex-felons find it difficult to reintegrate with society due to lack of resources/opportunities. A small amount of cash will help them readjust to normal life. 2) It helps corporations pursue their social justice initiatives and improve their reputation.

# How it works
Users connect to their Metamask wallet. Once this is done, they can view the amount of ETH currently in the vault and choose to make a donation.
