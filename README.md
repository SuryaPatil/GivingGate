# GivingGate
A decentralized charity fund powered by blockchain where corporations can donate to, and where recent ex-felons can withdraw money from. This solves two important issues: 1) Many ex-felons find it difficult to reintegrate with society due to lack of resources/opportunities. A small amount of cash will help them readjust to normal life. 2) It helps corporations pursue their social justice initiatives and improve their reputation.
